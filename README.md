 ## About The Project

![Product Screenshot]()

There are many great starter kits and templates available on GitHub; however, I found them to be very opinionated and bloated. This awesome boilerplate focuses on developer experience and maintainability while giving you the freedom to create web apps faster.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like finding ESLint configs and rulesets, or scaffolding commit lint and husky from scratch.


Of course, no one template will serve all projects, since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
